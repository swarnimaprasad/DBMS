## Backend Overview: SQL Schema


student: Stores student details like name, email (unique), password, and enrolled course.

course: Contains course names and instructor information.

enrollment: A many-to-many mapping between students and courses using foreign keys.

Sample data is inserted to show a working model — with 2 students, 2 courses, and enrollment records.

This schema ensures data normalization, referential integrity, and scalability for future additions like multiple semesters or grades.
